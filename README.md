Free, open-source AI academic paper reviewer that outperforms popular paid AI reviewers.

You provide your own API key and pay the LLM provider directly — typically **under $2 per review**.

Don't want to run it locally? Use the [web interface](https://coarse.vercel.app/) instead.

## Quickstart

Get an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (free to sign up), then:

```bash
uvx coarse-ink review paper.pdf --api-key sk-or-v1-YOUR_KEY
```

That's it. The review is written to `paper_review.md` in the current directory.

### Prerequisites

coarse requires Python 3.12+. If you don't have `uvx`, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

`uvx` runs coarse in a temporary environment with no permanent install. To install permanently:

```bash
uv tool install coarse-ink    # or: pip install coarse-ink
```

> **Why `coarse-ink` and not `coarse`?** The bare `coarse` name on PyPI is
> held by an unrelated package, so we ship under `coarse-ink`. The Python
> import name (`import coarse`) and the `coarse` CLI command are unchanged
> — installing `coarse-ink` puts both `coarse` and `coarse-ink` on your
> PATH.

### Save your API key

To avoid passing `--api-key` every time, create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-YOUR_KEY
```

Or run `coarse setup` to store keys in `~/.coarse/config.toml`.

## Supported formats

PDF, TXT, Markdown, LaTeX, DOCX, HTML, and EPUB. PDFs use Mistral OCR; other formats use
Docling (if installed) with lightweight fallbacks. Install optional format support:

```bash
pip install coarse-ink[formats]   # DOCX, HTML, EPUB fallbacks
pip install coarse-ink[docling]   # Docling for PDF/DOCX/HTML/LaTeX
```

## How it works

```
paper.pdf (or .txt, .md, .tex, .docx, .html, .epub)
  -> Mistral OCR (Docling fallback)      Extract text as markdown
  -> Vision LLM spot-check               Optional QA (auto-triggers on garbled text)
  -> Structure analysis                   Parse sections, detect math content, classify domain
  -> Domain calibration + lit search      Parallel: domain-specific criteria + Perplexity Sonar Pro
  -> Overview agent                       Single macro-level review pass
  -> Completeness agent                   Structural-gap pass merged into overview
  -> Section agents + proof verification  Parallel: 15-25 detailed comments; math sections get adversarial proof check
  -> Cross-section synthesis              Results vs discussion consistency check
  -> Editorial filter                     Primary deduplication, contradiction, and quality pass
  -> Legacy crossref/critique fallback    Only used if the editorial pass fails
  -> Quote verification                   Fuzzy-match quotes against paper text (stricter for math)
  -> Synthesis                            Render final paper_review.md
```

The pipeline extracts text, classifies the paper's domain and structure, then generates
domain-specific review criteria and searches for related literature (via
[Perplexity Sonar Pro](https://docs.perplexity.ai/), with arXiv fallback). A single
overview pass produces macro-level feedback, completeness can add structural gaps, and
section agents run in parallel with adversarial proof verification for math-heavy sections.
A conditional cross-section pass checks whether discussion claims are supported by formal
results, and an editorial pass is the primary deduplication and quality gate. All quotes
are programmatically verified against the source text, with stricter thresholds for math
content.

## Model selection

Pass any litellm-compatible model string with `--model`:

```bash
coarse review paper.pdf --model openai/gpt-4o
coarse review paper.pdf --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
coarse review paper.pdf --model gemini/gemini-3-flash-preview
```

The default model is `qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15` routed via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).
Any model supported by [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) works.
With only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set, all models (including vision QA) route through OpenRouter automatically.

Use `--cheap` to automatically select the cheapest model for which you have an API key.

## API keys

Only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is needed. This covers everything: review agents,
literature search, and PDF extraction (Mistral OCR is always routed through
OpenRouter's file-parser plugin, so there's no separate key for it). For
step-by-step setup instructions, see the [API key guide](https://coarse.vercel.app/setup).

> **Set your OpenRouter per-key spend limit to at least $10** (ideally matching
> the `max_cost_usd` default of `$10`). If the limit is hit mid-review the run
> will fail and you'll need to raise the limit and resubmit. Cost estimates
> shown before each review are approximate (~30% buffer) — they're a guide,
> not a hard ceiling, so leave yourself headroom.

For direct provider access to chat models (lower latency, separate billing),
you can set the provider-specific key instead:

| Provider   | Environment variable   |
|------------|------------------------|
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`   |
| OpenAI     | `OPENAI_API_KEY`       |
| Anthropic  | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`    |
| Google     | `GEMINI_API_KEY`       |
| Mistral    | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`      |
| Groq       | `GROQ_API_KEY`         |
| Together   | `TOGETHER_API_KEY`     |
| Cohere     | `COHERE_API_KEY`       |
| Azure      | `AZURE_API_KEY`        |

## Cost

coarse estimates cost before running and asks for confirmation. The estimate includes a
30% buffer to account for variance.

| Paper length    | Typical cost  |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Short (< 20pp)  | $0.25 - $0.50 |
| Long (30+ pp)   | $0.50 - $1    |

**Actual costs can run materially above the estimate** on complex papers depending on
model reasoning depth, editorial filtering behavior, and proof-verification chains
for math-heavy sections. The built-in buffer is conservative, not a ceiling.
Make sure your OpenRouter per-key spend limit has headroom above the estimate.

The default spending cap is **$10 per review** (`max_cost_usd` in config). Use `--yes` to skip the
confirmation prompt. Use `--no-qa` to skip the post-extraction quality check (vision LLM).
Scanned PDFs are supported via Docling's built-in OCR (`pip install coarse-ink[docling]`).

You can also load API keys from any `.env` file with `--env-file path/to/.env`.

## Output format

The review is written as a structured markdown file:

```
# Paper Title

**Date**: MM/DD/YYYY
**Domain**: social_sciences/economics
**Taxonomy**: academic/research_paper
**Filter**: Active comments

---

## Overall Feedback

4-6 macro issues with titles and body paragraphs.

---

## Detailed Comments (N)

20+ numbered comments, each with a verbatim quote from the paper and
actionable feedback.
```

## Python API

```python
from coarse import review_paper
from pathlib import Path

review, markdown, paper_text = review_paper(
    pdf_path=Path("paper.pdf"),  # accepts any supported format
    model="openai/gpt-4o",       # optional; uses config default if omitted
)

print(markdown)                         # full review as markdown string
print(review.detailed_comments[0].feedback)  # access structured fields
```

`review_paper` returns a `(Review, str, PaperText)` tuple: the structured `Review` model,
rendered markdown, and the extracted paper text. The `pdf_path` parameter accepts any
supported file format (PDF, TXT, MD, TeX, DOCX, HTML, EPUB).

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `~/.coarse/config.toml`:

```toml
default_model = "qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15"
vision_model = "gemini/gemini-3-flash-preview"
extraction_qa = true
max_cost_usd = 10.0

[api_keys]
openai = "sk-..."
anthropic = "sk-ant-..."
```

Run `coarse setup` for an interactive prompt that writes this file.

## Development

```bash
